Welcome to "Devil's Corp," the sickest pixel art shooter you'll ever play! You get to be Alister, a badass shinigami with a killer job - hunting and delivering demonic souls to the one and only Devil himself. 

We've got it all: sick animations, a freaking awesome metal soundtrack, and a totally bonkers story that's gonna have you laughing your butt off. And don't worry, we promise not to be too offensive (but if we are, just suck it up, buttercup). So grab your weapon, hone your skills, and get ready to blast those stupid demons back to hell where they belong. And hey, by playing this game, you'll be helping Alister pay for his Gamepass, Coke, and Cheetos - so it's a win-win situation!
